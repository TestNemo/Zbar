The example is to show the zbar library. It combined with opencv and zbar. 
The opencv library is located in opencvpkg which is generated with the AM5716 cross compiler tool chain. 
To build the example code, two steps need to perform:
1. Go to src fold to make the zbar library or go to the top fold to make.
2. Go to the example fold to make, it will generate the TestZbar executing program.
